# MyProjectsCodes

This repository specifically contains the codes I developed. Their are sometimes the statistical and predictive analysis 
of a given data taken from Kaggle or DrivenData. Sometimes they are developping a predictive methode in Machine Learning, for
example in one code I developped a Matrix Factorization withour using the pre-written packages.
